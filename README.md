work in progress, i have simple CRUD operators working but they all require an _id.

theres no active validator, so you can make multiple char with the same name.

for some reason the create char keeps stating a failure yet posts a new char regardless.

create char, update char, delete char, and check char all work and match the CRUD requirments for the assignment.

use the credentials i linked in the comment section of the assignment 
submission if needed.
