Personality:
I retreated from society after a life changing event, I've discovered an ancient lost city in the mountains, and have returned to society to earn a means of creating an expedition. I'm utterly serene, even in the face of disaster.

Ideal: meddling in the affairs of others causes trouble.

Bond: I entered seclusion to hide from those who were hunting me.

Flaw: now that I've returned to the broad world, I enjoy it a bit too much
